# (you) , She has gone missing. You love her.
The path is ladened with challenges.
# you are in a hurry. Love's worth running for.
But is it worth all of this, #?
Losing yourself for her.
Because you are left with only $ chances to save her.
You are a shadow of your former self #.
You could turn back now. While you still can.
What would happen if you simply cease to exist?
Become one dimensional, lose her forever.
Would it be better to go separate ways, and guarantee survival?
Chances are dwindling now, #.
Will she even be there?
All these challenges are slowly eating away at you.
1 Chance left
The final hurdle in your journey
She is there.
